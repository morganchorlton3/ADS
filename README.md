## About This Project

This project is my individual project for my final year assignment at university I will be creating a full supermarket home delivery system, the project will consist of two main components, the web aspect where the customers can order products, the web aspect will also have an admin panel for the store to manage and view orders. There will also be the mobile application for the delivery drivers and store pickers, the mobile application will show pickers the product locations in the store, the mobile application can also be used by the delivery driver to navigate to each delivery, the application will also show the driver what items need to be delivered.

I have also createad a simple POS system to help with stock controll, this works as a till would in the shop and constantly updates the stock of each item purchased.
